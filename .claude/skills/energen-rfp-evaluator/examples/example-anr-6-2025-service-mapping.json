    "All 5 requested services map cleanly to existing Energen service offerings (A, B, C, D, E)",
    "Service B quarterly frequency is higher than typical annual - confirms combined quarterly A+B visits",
    "No custom or non-standard services requested - reduces risk and complexity",
    "Service D (analysis) has minimal labor component - primarily lab fees",
    "Service E (load bank) for 2000kW generator may require specialty equipment rental",
