# Energen UI Verifier - Production Readiness Gate

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Prevent "breaks on first click" disasters through comprehensive UI/UX verification
**Status:** Complete skill implementation

---

## What This Skill Does

This skill provides **EXCRUCIATINGLY DETAILED** verification of the Energen Calculator v5.0 UI/UX workflow. It exists because previous work was declared "100% production ready" but failed on first click.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ 9-phase workflow verification (160+ checks)
- ✅ Evidence-based testing (screenshots + console logs + API validation)
- ✅ Element-by-element validation
- ✅ Expected vs actual comparison for every field
- ✅ Complete Zoho integration verification
- ✅ Automatic error recovery patterns
- ✅ UNFORGIVING production ready gate

**What "Production Ready" Actually Means:**
- ALL 9 phases pass without errors
- ALL UI elements functional
- ALL calculations accurate (within 1% tolerance)
- ALL data transfers to Zoho correctly
- ALL lookups/links working
- ZERO console errors
- Evidence provided for every claim

```

### Setup Steps

1. **Ensure server is running:**
```bash
cd c:\ECalc\active\energen-calculator-v5.0
node src/api/server-secure.cjs
```

2. **Verify server health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

3. **Check test data exists:**
```bash
ls test-data/20-real-businesses-test-dataset.json
```

4. **Create results directories:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/energen-ui-verifier/results/screenshots

## How to Run Verification

### Method 1: Automated (via script)

**When to use:** After manual validation confirms workflow works

```bash
# Run automated verification
node .claude/skills/energen-ui-verifier/scripts/run-ui-verification.cjs

# Exit code 0 = PASS (production ready)
# Exit code 1 = FAIL (NOT production ready)
```

**Note:** The automated script currently has placeholder implementations. It needs to be enhanced with actual Playwright MCP calls before it can run real tests.

### Method 2: Manual (via checklist)

**When to use:** First-time verification, debugging, detailed analysis

1. Open `resources/workflow-checklist.md`
2. Follow each phase step-by-step
3. Check off each item as completed
4. Take screenshots at every phase
5. Document any failures with evidence

### Method 3: AI-Assisted (via skill invocation)

**When to use:** With Claude Code or another AI agent

1. Invoke the skill: `@energen-ui-verifier`
2. Follow the AI's guided verification
3. Provide evidence at each step
4. AI will execute Playwright MCP calls
5. AI will generate comprehensive report

## Understanding "Production Ready"

### ✅ PRODUCTION READY means:
- ✅ 100% of checks passed
- ✅ Complete workflow functional end-to-end
- ✅ All data accurate (form → calculator → PDF → Zoho)
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ All API calls successful
- ✅ All Zoho records created with correct links
- ✅ Performance acceptable (<60s total workflow)

### ❌ NOT PRODUCTION READY means:
- ❌ ANY check failed
- ❌ ANY console error
- ❌ ANY calculation incorrect
- ❌ ANY data missing in Zoho
- ❌ ANY link broken
- ❌ ANY workflow cannot complete

**There is no middle ground.** Either it's production ready or it's not.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Page doesn't load"
**Symptoms:** Phase 0 fails, timeout on navigation
**Solution:**
1. Check server running: `curl http://localhost:3002/health`
2. Check port: Verify server on 3002 (not 5176)
3. Check firewall: Allow localhost:3002
4. Restart server

### Issue: "Autocomplete doesn't appear"
**Symptoms:** Phase 1 fails, address autocomplete missing
**Solution:**
1. Check Google Maps API loaded: Open console, type `window.google`
2. Check API key valid: Look for errors in Network tab
3. Type slowly: Autocomplete needs time to trigger
4. Wait 2+ seconds after typing

### Issue: "Calculation returns $0.00"
**Symptoms:** Phase 5 fails, all services show $0.00
**Solution:**
1. Verify services selected via DOM (not just state)
2. Check E2E-004: Service selection may require physical clicks
3. Check console for API errors
4. Verify generator kW entered
5. Verify fuel type selected

### Issue: "PDF shows $0.00 quarterly totals"
**Symptoms:** Phase 7 fails, PDF pricing incorrect
**Solution:**
1. Check Bug #6: PDF template data format mismatch
2. Verify state.units[0].serverCalculations exists
3. Check serviceBreakdown has correct field names
4. Verify frequency field present in each service
5. Check professional-pdf-service.js for data source

### Issue: "Zoho quote line items all $0.00"
**Symptoms:** Phase 8 fails, Zoho pricing wrong
**Solution:**
1. Check Bug #4: Pricing data flow issue
2. Verify calculation.serviceBreakdown in payload
3. Check zoho-cpq-integration.cjs pricing mapping
4. Verify frequency field in serviceBreakdown
5. Check product IDs are valid (not null)

### Issue: "Generator asset not linking to account"
**Symptoms:** Phase 8 fails, asset lookup broken
**Solution:**
1. Check E2E-008: Generator asset MCP tool issue
2. Verify Account created first (get Account ID)
3. Check Customer_Account field in asset payload
4. Use direct API if MCP not working
5. Verify lookup field metadata in Zoho

## Known Limitations

### Documented Issues (from E2E_BUGS_TRACKING.json):

**E2E-001 (CRITICAL):** Chrome DevTools MCP timeout
- **Impact:** Cannot use Chrome DevTools for automation
- **Workaround:** Use Playwright MCP (this skill uses Playwright)

**E2E-002 (HIGH):** Clear All button 5+ second delay
- **Impact:** Slow workflow reset
- **Workaround:** Wait patiently, no fix available

**E2E-003 (MEDIUM):** Phone/website fields retain data
- **Impact:** Data integrity risk between tests
- **Workaround:** Manually clear these fields

**E2E-004 (CRITICAL):** Quote calculation requires DOM clicks
- **Impact:** Cannot set services programmatically
- **Workaround:** Use Playwright to click UI elements

**E2E-005 (HIGH):** PDF libraries not detected
- **Impact:** May block PDF generation testing
- **Workaround:** Verify libraries loaded before PDF phase

**E2E-006 (MEDIUM):** Validation tied to DOM
- **Impact:** Cannot bypass validation in tests
- **Workaround:** Fill forms via UI interaction

**E2E-007 (CRITICAL):** Zoho product workflow
- **Status:** FIXED (auto-creation implemented)

**E2E-008 (HIGH):** Generator asset MCP not implemented
- **Impact:** May need direct API fallback
- **Workaround:** Use zoho-generator-asset-api.cjs directly

Claude: "VERIFICATION COMPLETE

Phase 0: ✅ PASSED (7/7)
Phase 1: ✅ PASSED (15/15)
Phase 2: ✅ PASSED (11/11)
Phase 3: ✅ PASSED (18/18)
Phase 4: ❌ FAILED (30/36) - Service D pricing shows $0.00
...

Overall: NOT PRODUCTION READY
Issue: Service D pricing calculation broken
Evidence: failure-phase4-1729180000.png

Recommendation: Fix Service D pricing logic before deployment"
```

### Example 3: Interpreting Results JSON

```javascript
// Load verification report
const report = require('./results/verification-report-1729180000.json');

// Check overall status
console.log(`Production Ready: ${report.production_ready}`); // true or false

// Check specific phase
const phase4 = report.phases.phase4_service_selection;
console.log(`Phase 4 Status: ${phase4.status}`); // PASS or FAIL
console.log(`Phase 4 Passed: ${phase4.passed}/${phase4.checks}`);

// Check for failures
if (report.failures.length > 0) {
  console.log('Failures found:');
  report.failures.forEach(f => {
    console.log(`- ${f.phase}: ${f.check} - ${f.reason}`);
  });
}

// View evidence
console.log(`Screenshots: ${report.evidence.screenshots.length}`);
console.log(`Console Logs: ${report.evidence.console_logs.length}`);
```

## FAQs

**Q: How long does full verification take?**
A: Manual: 30-60 minutes. Automated: 45-90 seconds (when fully implemented).

**Q: Can I skip phases?**
A: No. All phases must pass for production ready status.

**Q: What if only one check fails?**
A: Not production ready. Must fix and re-verify.

**Q: Can I run on different port?**
A: Yes. Update CONFIG.BASE_URL in run-ui-verification.cjs

**Q: Why so strict?**
A: Previous "production ready" claims failed on first click. This prevents that.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: Playwright supports Chromium, Firefox, WebKit. Chromium recommended.

**Q: Can I test in production?**
A: NO. Only test against localhost development server.

**Q: How do I report bugs?**
