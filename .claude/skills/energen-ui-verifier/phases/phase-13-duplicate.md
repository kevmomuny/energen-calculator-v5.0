### Phase 13: Duplicate Quote Workflow
**Purpose:** Verify quote duplication functionality

**Test Sequence:**
1. Complete quote calculation (prerequisite)
2. Click "Duplicate" button
3. Verify duplicate modal opens
4. Verify shows current quote details
5. Modify duplicate name/identifier
6. Click "Confirm Duplicate"
7. Verify new quote created
8. Verify new quote has same data as original
9. Verify new quote has different ID
10. Verify can modify duplicate independently

**Evidence Required:**
- Screenshot of duplicate modal
- Comparison of original vs duplicate data
- Verification of independent modification
- state.quotes array verification

**Fail If:**
- Duplicate modal doesn't open
- Duplicate doesn't create
- Duplicate missing data
- Modifications affect original
