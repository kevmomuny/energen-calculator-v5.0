## SERVER RESTART PROTOCOL (After Bug Fixes)

**Critical:** Code changes require server restart. Node.js caches modules; file edits won't apply until server reloaded.

**Problem Symptoms:**
- API returns old/incorrect data despite code fixes
- Calculation results don't match updated formulas
- New features don't appear in responses
- Console shows old error messages

**Root Cause:**
Old server process (PID) still running with cached version of code. Must kill zombie process and start fresh.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: SURGICAL PROCESS MANAGEMENT

**üö® THE MISTAKE THAT KILLS CLAUDE CODE ITSELF:**

**Claude Code runs in a Node.js process.** When you kill Node processes indiscriminately, **you terminate Claude Code itself.** This causes immediate disconnection and requires manual restart by the user.

**USE THE SAFE RESTART SCRIPT:**
```powershell
# From project root - safest method
.\safe-server-restart.ps1

# This script:
# 1. Finds process on port 3002 by PID
# 2. Verifies it's not Claude Code
# 3. Kills only the specific server PID
# 4. Optionally restarts the server
```

**THE MISTAKE THAT KILLS YOUR OWN NODE:**

When testing requires killing the Energen server process, you MUST be surgical and precise. The test environment runs in a Node.js process itself - if you kill node processes indiscriminately, you kill yourself.

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS (Self-Destructive):**
```javascript
// This kills ALL node processes including the one running Claude Code MCP
taskkill /IM node.exe /F

// This kills ALL PIDs in a list without checking which is YOUR process
Stop-Process -Id 32012,26404,10300,...  // One of these might be YOU!

// This kills processes by name pattern (too broad)
Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force

// This kills background bash shells indiscriminately
KillShell(shell_id_1), KillShell(shell_id_2), ...  // Might kill your own shell
```

**‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS (Surgical):**
```javascript
// 1. IDENTIFY the SPECIFIC PID listening on port 3002
netstat -ano | findstr ":3002"
// Output: TCP  0.0.0.0:3002  ...  LISTENING  32012

// 2. VERIFY this PID is NOT your own process
// Check: Is this PID different from Desktop Commander's PID?
// Check: Is this PID from a server startup you control?

// 3. KILL ONLY the specific PID for port 3002
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Id 32012 -Force"

// 4. VERIFY the kill was successful
netstat -ano | findstr ":3002"
// Should return empty (no output)
```

**ANALOGY:** A surgeon removing an appendix doesn't cut off their own head. You are performing surgery on the server process while your own Node.js process is the surgeon. Be precise.

**SAFE WORKFLOW:**
1. **Identify target PID**: `netstat -ano | findstr ":3002"` ‚Üí PID 32012
2. **Verify target**: "Is PID 32012 the server I want to kill?" (YES)
3. **Cross-check**: "Is PID 32012 my Desktop Commander process?" (NO)
4. **Kill target**: `powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Id 32012 -Force"`
5. **Verify death**: `netstat -ano | findstr ":3002"` ‚Üí (empty)
6. **Start fresh**: `node src/api/server-secure.cjs` ‚Üí New PID 28888

**ZOMBIE PROCESS CLEANUP:**
If you have multiple zombie servers from previous test runs, kill them ONE BY ONE by PID:
```powershell
# Find all node processes listening on 3002 (should be only one)
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3002 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess

# Kill ONLY that specific PID
Stop-Process -Id [SPECIFIC_PID] -Force
```

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Kill all node.exe processes (you ARE node.exe)
- ‚ùå Kill all background bash processes (one might be yours)
- ‚ùå Use broad process name filters (node, bash, etc.)
- ‚ùå Kill PIDs without verifying which is the server

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Identify specific PID via port (netstat)
- ‚úÖ Kill ONE specific PID at a time
- ‚úÖ Verify kill success before starting new server
- ‚úÖ Test server is responding before declaring success

**If you violate this rule:** Your own Node.js process dies, Desktop Commander disconnects, and the testing session terminates abruptly. The user has to restart everything. This is like a surgeon cutting off their own head during surgery.

### METHOD 1: Desktop Commander (PREFERRED)

**Best for:** Clean, reliable process management with proper error handling

```javascript
// 1. Find current server PID using netstat (can also use list_processes)
// NOTE: list_processes output is malformed on Windows - use PowerShell commands instead

// 2. Kill old process using Desktop Commander
mcp__desktop-commander__start_process({
  command: "Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3002 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_ -Force }",
  shell: "powershell.exe",
  timeout_ms: 5000
});

// 3. Wait for port to release
sleep(2);

// 4. Start new server using Desktop Commander
mcp__desktop-commander__start_process({
  command: "Set-Location C:/ECalc/active/energen-calculator-v5.0; node src/api/server-secure.cjs",
  shell: "powershell.exe",
  timeout_ms: 8000  // Wait for startup logs
});

// 5. Verify server started by checking startup logs in response
// Look for: "info: RFP processing endpoints mounted at /api/rfp"
// Look for: "info: ‚úÖ Zoho integration endpoints registered"

// 6. Navigate to fresh page and test
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Proper PowerShell execution (no bash compatibility issues)
- ‚úÖ Returns startup logs immediately (see "info:" messages)
- ‚úÖ Detects port conflicts ("EADDRINUSE: address already in use")
- ‚úÖ Can monitor process output with interact_with_process
- ‚úÖ Clean error handling

**Example Output (Success):**
```
Process started with PID 22056 (shell: powershell.exe)
Initial output:
info: Generator enrichment: Claude API enabled
info: üîß Verifying Zoho products via Catalyst...
info: RFP processing endpoints mounted at /api/rfp
info: ‚úÖ Zoho integration endpoints registered
```

**Example Output (Port Conflict):**
```
error: üí• UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION: {"error":"listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3002"}
‚úÖ Process 22056 has finished execution
```
If you see this, a zombie process is still running. Retry step 2 (kill command).

---

### METHOD 2: Bash with PowerShell (FALLBACK)

**Use when:** Desktop Commander unavailable

```bash
# 1. Find process using port 3002
netstat -ano | findstr :3002
# Returns: TCP  0.0.0.0:3002  ...  LISTENING  [PID]

# 2. Kill the old process
# NOTE: Standard bash 'kill' doesn't work with Windows PIDs in Git Bash
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Id [PID] -Force"

# 3. Verify port is released
netstat -ano | findstr :3002
# Should return empty (no output)

# 4. Start fresh server (will fail with "stdin is not a tty")
# Background bash processes show stderr but server still starts
cd C:/ECalc/active/energen-calculator-v5.0 && node src/api/server-secure.cjs
# Run with: run_in_background=true

# 5. Wait for server startup
sleep 3

# 6. Verify new process running
netstat -ano | findstr :3002
# Should show NEW PID

# 7. Test updated endpoint
# Navigate to fresh page to avoid browser cache
```

**Background Bash Process Caveat:**
- Background bash (`run_in_background=true`) shows "stdin is not a tty" error
- This is NORMAL - server still starts successfully
- BashOutput will show `status: failed, exit_code: 1, stderr: stdin is not a tty`
- **IGNORE the "failed" status** - verify server via netstat or page navigation instead

**Why Bash Fails:**
- Git Bash/MINGW64 runs in pseudo-terminal (PTY)
- Background processes can't access stdin in PTY
- Node.js checks stdin availability on startup
- Reports error but continues running anyway
- This is architectural limitation, not actual failure

---

### METHOD 3: Multiple Retry Strategy (CURRENT WORKAROUND)

**What Actually Happens:**
When you attempt multiple server starts via bash (`run_in_background=true`), some succeed despite showing "failed" status:
- Try 1: Background bash ID `a90b5e` - shows "failed" but **server actually starts**
- Try 2: Background bash ID `3bbacf` - shows "failed" but **server actually starts** 
- Try 3: Background bash ID `447749` - shows "failed" but **server actually starts**
- Try 4: Background bash ID `bfce33` - shows "failed" but **server already running**

One of these processes IS serving on port 3002, we just can't tell which from the error messages.

**Detection:**
```bash
# If navigate_page succeeds, server is running!
mcp__chrome-devtools__navigate_page("http://localhost:3002/integrated-ui.html")
# Success = One of those "failed" processes is actually serving
# ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED = No server running, retry with Method 1
```

**Current State Evidence:**
- Multiple background bash processes show "stdin is not a tty" (normal)
- Chrome DevTools successfully navigated to page (server IS running)
- Server has UPDATED code (quarterlyTotals fix applied)
- Don't kill these processes - one is serving correctly!

**Verification Checklist After Restart:**
1. ‚úÖ Old PID killed (netstat shows different PID or empty)
2. ‚úÖ New PID listening on port 3002
3. ‚úÖ Navigate to FRESH page (clear cache or new incognito window)
4. ‚úÖ Test endpoint returns expected data (not cached old response)
5. ‚úÖ Console shows no errors from new code
6. ‚úÖ Updated functionality works as expected

**Example: Quarterly Totals Bug Fix:**
```bash
# Before fix: PID 20808 running, hasQuarterlyTotals: false
# After code edit in complete-calculation-engine.cjs line 1210
# Server still returns false because PID 20808 has old cached code

# Kill old process:
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Id 20808 -Force"

# Start new server (gets new PID like 31428):
node src/api/server-secure.cjs &

# Test now returns: hasQuarterlyTotals: true with Q1-Q4 data
```

**When to Use This Protocol:**
- After ANY edit to `src/api/*.cjs` files
- After modifying calculation engine
- After updating API endpoints
- After changing server configuration
- After installing new npm packages
- Whenever API responses don't reflect code changes

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Use `kill -9 [PID]` (doesn't work with Windows PIDs in this bash environment)
- ‚ùå Use `taskkill /F /PID [PID]` (syntax errors in Git Bash)
- ‚ùå Assume server hot-reloads (it doesn't)
- ‚ùå Test immediately after starting (wait 3-5 seconds for server initialization)
- ‚ùå Reuse same browser tab (may have cached responses - open fresh tab)

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Use PowerShell via bash: `powershell -Command "Stop-Process..."`
- ‚úÖ Verify port release before starting new server
- ‚úÖ Verify new PID different from old PID
- ‚úÖ Test with fresh browser page/incognito
- ‚úÖ Check console logs for confirmation of new code execution
