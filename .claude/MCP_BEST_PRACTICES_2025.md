# MCP Best Practices Report - October 2025
## Context Window Optimization & Zero-Hallucination Tool Usage

**Research Date:** October 29, 2025
**Sources:** Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Industry Best Practices
**Purpose:** Optimal MCP tool integration for Claude Code with minimal context impact

---

## Executive Summary

Based on the latest research from Anthropic (October 2025), the optimal approach for MCP integration combines:

1. **Skills-First Architecture** - Use Skills for workflows, MCP for external system access
2. **Token-Optimized Tool Descriptions** - Reduce tool definitions by 70%+ through compression
3. **Dynamic Server Management** - Enable/disable MCP servers on-demand using `/mcp` command
4. **Zero-Hallucination Patterns** - Explicit permission to admit uncertainty, quote-based responses

**Key Finding:** Skills reduce repetitive prompt engineering time by 73% compared to traditional approaches, while consuming dozens of tokens vs. thousands for MCP servers.

## Part 1: The Context Window Problem (2025)

### Current State

**Claude Sonnet 4.5 Context Window:** 200,000 tokens

**Typical Token Consumption Before Conversation:**
- System prompt: ~5,000 tokens
- MCP tool definitions: 10,000-66,000 tokens (can consume 33% of context!)
- Memory files: 2,000-5,000 tokens
- Custom agents: varies
- **Result:** Only 60-70% of context available for actual work

### Real-World Impact

One developer reported: *"MCP tools consumed over 66,000 tokens before conversation even began - one-third of the context window."*

**Token Cost Per Tool:**
- Simple tool: 50-100 tokens
- Enterprise tool with detailed schemas: 500-1,000 tokens
- 50+ tools = 10,000+ tokens (5% of context)
- Power users with multiple servers = 20,000+ tokens

## Part 2: Skills vs MCP - When to Use Each

### The New Paradigm (October 2025)

Simon Willison (noted AI researcher): *"Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP"*

Industry consensus: **Skills represent a radically different approach** - instead of connecting to external systems, Skills teach Claude HOW to perform tasks through organized instructions.

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Use Skills | Use MCP |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Teach Claude a workflow** | ✅ YES | ❌ No |
| **Connect to external database** | ❌ No | ✅ YES |
| **Define coding standards** | ✅ YES | ❌ No |
| **Access Zoho Books API** | ❌ No | ✅ YES |
| **Document review process** | ✅ YES | ❌ No |
| **Query GitHub PRs** | ❌ No | ✅ YES |
| **Style guide enforcement** | ✅ YES | ❌ No |
| **File system operations** | ❌ No | ✅ YES |
| **Repeatable 3+ weekly tasks** | ✅ YES | Maybe |
| **One-off exploration** | ❌ Prompt | ❌ No |

### Skills Excel At:
- Repeatable workflows (3+ weekly uses)
- Structured, repeatable tasks (doc/report generation, style checks)
- Teaching Claude procedures, workflows, standards, patterns
- **Token efficiency**: Metadata uses dozens of tokens; full content loads only when needed

### MCP Excels At:
- Connecting Claude TO external systems (databases, APIs, cloud services)
- Real-time data access (Zoho, GitHub, Slack, databases)
- System operations (file management, git operations)

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Best Practice:** Use Skills as MCP clients

```
Skills → Orchestrate workflows
  ↓
MCP → Execute specific external operations
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces server complexity by 40-60% vs. pure MCP
- Skills maintain workflow logic (low token cost)
- MCP handles external access (only loaded when needed)
- Clean separation of concerns

## Part 3: Token Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Tool Description Compression (70%+ reduction)

**Case Study:** Apollo MCP Server achieved 72.5% token reduction (5,819 → 1,603 tokens)

**Before (Verbose):**
```json
{
  "name": "create_contact",
  "description": "This tool creates a new customer or vendor contact in the Zoho Books system. It accepts various parameters including contact name, company name, full billing address with street, city, state, ZIP code and country, primary phone number, email address, and payment terms. The tool will validate all inputs and return the newly created contact ID along with a success confirmation message. Use this tool when you need to add a new customer to the billing system or register a new vendor for purchase orders.",
  "parameters": { ... }
}
```
**Token Cost:** ~150 tokens

**After (Optimized):**
```json
{
  "name": "create_contact",
  "description": "Create Zoho Books customer/vendor. Returns contact_id.",
  "parameters": { ... }
}
```
**Token Cost:** ~35 tokens

**Reduction:** 77%

### Strategy 2: Parameter Schema Optimization

**Before:**
```json
{
  "billing_address": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "The complete billing address for the contact, including street address, city, state or province, postal or ZIP code, and country. This information will be used for invoicing and shipping purposes.",
    "properties": {
      "address": { "type": "string", "description": "Street address including building number and street name" },
      "city": { "type": "string", "description": "City or municipality name" },
      "state": { "type": "string", "description": "State, province, or region" },
      "zip": { "type": "string", "description": "Postal code or ZIP code" }
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "billing_address": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "Address for invoicing",
    "properties": {
      "address": { "type": "string" },
      "city": { "type": "string" },
      "state": { "type": "string" },
      "zip": { "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Remove redundant descriptions
- ✅ Use concise but clear language
- ✅ Reference external docs instead of embedding examples
- ✅ Eliminate verbose enum descriptions
- ✅ Use field names that are self-explanatory

### Strategy 3: Selective Tool Exposure

**Use `allowed_tools` parameter:**
```json
{
  "server": "energen-books-customers",
  "tools": ["create_contact", "list_contacts", "get_contact"]
  // Don't load all 50+ tools - only what's needed
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces token overhead
- Improves response time
- Narrows model's decision space (reduces hallucination)
- Faster tool selection with fewer mistakes

## Part 4: Dynamic MCP Server Management

### The `/mcp` Command (v2.0.10+)

**Enable/disable MCP servers dynamically:**

```
# Check current status
/mcp

# Disable heavy server when not needed
/mcp disable energen-data-explorer

# Enable when needed
/mcp enable energen-data-explorer

# Monitor impact
/context
```

### The `/context` Command (v1.0.86+)

**Shows token usage breakdown:**
- System prompt
- Tools (built-in)
- MCP tools (per server)
- Memory files
- Custom agents
- Conversation history
- **Percentage of remaining context window**

**Auto-compaction:** Triggers around 80% usage for 200k windows

### Best Practice Workflow

1. **Start Minimal:**
   ```
   /mcp disable energen-data-explorer
   /mcp disable energen-crm-automation
   /mcp disable energen-crm-structure
   ```

2. **Enable On-Demand:**
   ```
   # User: "I need to query CRM workflows"
   /mcp enable energen-crm-automation
   # Work with workflows
   /mcp disable energen-crm-automation
   ```

3. **Monitor Constantly:**
   ```
   /context  # Check usage before major operations
   /clear    # Reset between tasks
   ```

## Part 5: Zero-Hallucination Tool Usage Patterns

### Official Anthropic Guidelines (October 2025)

#### Pattern 1: Explicit Permission to Admit Uncertainty

**❌ Bad Prompt:**
```
Create an invoice for ABC Corporation
```

**✅ Good Prompt:**
```
Create an invoice for ABC Corporation. If you cannot find the customer_id
or any required information, explicitly state what is missing rather than
guessing or making up values.
```

**Impact:** Drastically reduces false information

#### Pattern 2: Quote-Based Responses (RAG Pattern)

**For long documents (>20K tokens):**

```
Extract word-for-word quotes from the RFP document first, then use ONLY
those quotes to populate the pricing template. Do not use general knowledge
or make assumptions.
```

**Impact:** Reduces hallucinations by 40-65%

#### Pattern 3: Auditable Responses

**❌ Bad:**
```
"Based on the CRM data, customer prefers Net 30 terms"
```

**✅ Good:**
```
"Customer prefers Net 30 terms [Source: CRM Account record, Payment_Terms field,
retrieved 2025-10-29]"
```

**Impact:** Makes responses auditable and verifiable

#### Pattern 4: Restrict External Knowledge

**Explicit instruction:**
```
Use ONLY the information from the provided Zoho Books customer records.
Do NOT use your general knowledge about payment terms, addresses, or
contact information. If a field is empty in the API response, report it
as empty.
```

**Impact:** Prevents hallucination from model's training data

#### Pattern 5: Tool Result Inspection

**Host-side validation (implemented in Claude Code):**
- Inspect tool arguments BEFORE sending to MCP server
- Look for suspicious patterns, injection attempts, unexpected data formats
- Maintain explicit allowlist of permitted tools per session

#### Pattern 6: High-Risk Tool Confirmation

**For operations like:**
- Deleting data
- Transferring funds
- Mass updates
- Sending emails

**Pattern:**
```
1. Tool returns confirmation request instead of executing immediately
2. User reviews proposed action
3. User approves/denies
4. Then tool executes
```

## Part 6: Architectural Best Practices (2025)

### Recommended: Focused Services Pattern

**✅ Good Architecture:**
```
energen-books-customers    [5-10 tools]  → Customer/contact operations
energen-books-invoicing    [8-12 tools]  → Invoice/estimate operations
energen-crm-records        [5-8 tools]   → CRM CRUD operations
energen-crm-automation     [5-8 tools]   → Workflow/blueprint access
```

**Token Cost:** ~10,000-15,000 tokens (manageable)

**❌ Anti-Pattern: Monolithic Server:**
```
energen-mega-server        [80+ tools]   → Everything
```

**Token Cost:** 40,000-80,000 tokens (unmanageable)

### Benefits of Focused Services:

1. **Token Efficiency:** Only load relevant tool sets
2. **Faster Tool Selection:** Fewer options = less confusion
3. **Better Error Handling:** Isolated failure domains
4. **Easier Testing:** Test each service independently
5. **Clearer Purpose:** Each server has single responsibility

### Current Energen Architecture Analysis

**Current Setup (OPTIMAL):**
- ✅ energen-books-customers (focused)
- ✅ energen-books-invoicing (focused)
- ✅ energen-crm-records (focused)
- ✅ energen-crm-structure (focused)
- ✅ energen-crm-automation (focused)
- ✅ energen-data-explorer (specialized)
- ✅ energen-lean (lightweight subset)

**Verdict:** Architecture follows 2025 best practices!

## Part 7: Security Best Practices (October 2025 Update)

### Critical Security Guidelines

#### 1. Token Validation
**MUST NOT accept tokens not explicitly issued for the MCP server**

❌ Anti-pattern: "Token passthrough" - accepting tokens from client without validation

✅ Best practice: Validate tokens were issued specifically to your MCP server

#### 2. Supply Chain Security

**Before deploying MCP servers:**
- ✅ Maintain internal registry of approved servers
- ✅ Require security review before additions
- ✅ Implement organizational allowlisting
- ✅ Pin specific versions with hash verification
- ✅ Scan for vulnerabilities using SAST/SCA tools in CI/CD
- ✅ Cryptographically sign packages using Sigstore
- ✅ Verify signatures before execution

#### 3. Session ID Security (October 2025 Issue)

**⚠️ Current MCP Spec Problem:**
```
/messages/?sessionId=UUID  # Exposes sensitive IDs in logs/history
```

**Mitigation:**
- Use HTTPS always
- Implement short-lived session tokens
- Rotate session IDs frequently
- Don't log URLs with session IDs

#### 4. Tool Allowlisting

**Host should:**
- Maintain explicit list of permitted tools per session/user
- LLM should NOT be able to discover or call unapproved tools
- Dynamically adjust allowed tools based on user role/context

---

## Part 8: Optimal Energen MCP Strategy

### Recommended Implementation

#### Phase 1: Skills-Based Orchestration

**Create Skills for common workflows:**

**File:** `.claude/skills/energen-quote-generator/SKILL.md`
```markdown
# Quote Generator Skill

## Purpose
Generate complete generator service quotes using Zoho MCP tools.

## Workflow
1. Use energen-crm-records to fetch account details
2. Use energen-books-customers to verify/create Books customer
3. Use calculator API to compute pricing
4. Use energen-books-invoicing to create estimate
5. Use energen-books-invoicing to email estimate to customer

## Token Usage
Metadata: ~50 tokens
Full skill loads only when invoked: ~500 tokens

## MCP Servers Used
- energen-crm-records (on-demand)
- energen-books-customers (on-demand)
- energen-books-invoicing (on-demand)
```

**Benefits:**
- Workflow logic is in Skill (low token cost)
- MCP servers loaded only when Skill is invoked
- Reusable across projects
- Easy to test and maintain

#### Phase 2: Minimal Default MCP Configuration

**Default enabled (always loaded):**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "energen-lean": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://energen-lean-897662416.zohomcp.com/...",
      "tools": ["list_contacts", "get_contact", "list_invoices"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Token cost:** ~1,500-2,000 tokens (acceptable)

#### Phase 3: On-Demand Heavy Servers

**Load when needed:**
```
# User invokes quote-generator skill
→ Skill automatically enables needed MCP servers
→ energen-books-invoicing enabled
→ energen-crm-records enabled
→ Work completed
→ Skill disables servers
→ Context freed for next task
```

#### Phase 4: Tool Description Optimization

**Current tool descriptions:** Review and compress by 70%

**Example optimization needed:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (energen-books-customers server)
// Estimated: 8 tools × 200 tokens = 1,600 tokens

// AFTER (compressed descriptions)
// Target: 8 tools × 60 tokens = 480 tokens

// Reduction: 70%
```

**Action item:** Audit all Zoho MCP server tool descriptions in Zoho MCP console

---

## Part 9: Measurement & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

#### 1. Context Window Utilization
```bash
# Check before major operations
/context

# Target: Keep MCP tools under 15% of context
# Claude Sonnet 4.5: 200k tokens
# Target MCP usage: <30,000 tokens
# Remaining: 170k for actual work
```

#### 2. Tool Selection Accuracy
- Track how often Claude selects correct tool on first try
- Monitor tool call failures
- Target: >95% correct tool selection

#### 3. Response Time
- MCP tool calls add latency
- Monitor average response time
- Target: <2 seconds for simple queries

#### 4. Hallucination Rate
- Track instances where Claude provides incorrect information
- Use quote-based validation patterns
- Target: <2% hallucination rate (down from 5-10% baseline)

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Before starting work session
/mcp          # Check which servers are enabled
/context      # Check token usage

# During work
/context      # Monitor periodically

# Between tasks
/clear        # Reset context window

# After major changes
/context      # Verify optimization impact
```
